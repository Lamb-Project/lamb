- `POST /creator/signup` (during signup)
- `POST /creator/login` (during login)  
- `GET /creator/assistant/get_assistants` (loading assistants)
- `POST /creator/assistant/create` (creating assistant)
- Various configuration and capability requests

### Database Verification

After successful test completion, verify:
- User created in Creator_users table
- Corresponding OWI user created
- Assistant created with correct configuration
- All foreign key relationships intact

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing, optionally clean up test data:
- Delete created assistant
- Remove test user account
- Reset any modified configurations

## Automation Notes

This test suite can be automated using:
- Playwright for browser automation
- API testing tools for backend verification
- Database queries for data validation

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **Assistant Name Validation:** Names cannot contain spaces - use hyphens or underscores
2. **Language Display:** Some interface elements may show in Spanish initially
3. **Console Warnings:** Autocomplete warnings for password fields are expected and harmless

## Language Consistency Testing (i18n)

### Supported Languages
LAMB supports the following languages:
- **English (en)** - Default/fallback language
- **Spanish (es)** - Español
- **Catalan (ca)** - Català 
- **Basque (eu)** - Euskera

### Test Case 9: Language Selector Functionality

**Objective:** Verify the language selector works correctly and switches interface language.

**Steps:**
1. Locate the language selector button (shows current language, e.g., "EN")
2. Click the language selector button
3. Select each available language (Spanish, Catalan, Basque)
4. Verify the interface updates to the selected language
5. Test language persistence across page reloads

**Expected Results:**
- Language selector displays current language
- Dropdown shows all 4 supported languages: EN, ES, CA, EU
- Interface text updates immediately upon language selection
- Language preference persists across browser sessions
- Navigation, buttons, and form labels translate correctly
- No mixed language content in the same view

   - Home page (check news content and navigation)
   - Login/Signup forms (check all form labels and messages)
   - Learning Assistants page (check table headers, buttons, status messages)
   - Knowledge Bases page (check error messages, UI text)
   - MCP Testing page (check interface elements)
2. Repeat for Catalan (CA) and Basque (EU)
3. Check for untranslated text (text still appearing in English)
4. Verify translation consistency (same terms translated the same way)

**Expected Results for Spanish (ES):**
- Navigation: "Inicio", "Asistentes de Aprendizaje", "Bases de Conocimiento", "Pruebas MCP"
- Login form: "Iniciar Sesión", "Correo Electrónico", "Contraseña", "Registrarse"
- Assistant page: "Asistentes de Aprendizaje", "Mis Asistentes", "Crear Asistente"
- Buttons: "Editar", "Duplicar", "Eliminar", "Publicar"
- Status messages: "Publicado", "No Publicado"

**Expected Results for Catalan (CA):**
- Navigation: "Inici", "Assistents d'Aprenentatge", "Bases de Coneixement", "Proves MCP"
- Login form: "Iniciar Sessió", "Correu Electrònic", "Contrasenya", "Registrar-se"
- Assistant page: "Assistents d'Aprenentatge", "Els Meus Assistents", "Crear Assistent"

2. Pay special attention to:
   - Error messages and validation text
   - Dynamically loaded content (news, notifications)
   - Placeholder text in forms
   - Tooltip text and help messages
   - System prompts and templates (may be intentionally in Spanish)
3. Check console for any i18n loading errors or missing translation warnings

**Expected Results:**
- No English text in Spanish interface (except where intentionally mixed)
- System prompts may legitimately be in Spanish even when interface is in English
- Error messages display in the selected interface language
- All user-facing text respects the language selection

---

### Test Case 12: Language-Specific Content Handling

**Objective:** Verify language-specific content is handled correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Test assistant creation with different languages selected
2. Verify system prompts are provided in appropriate languages
3. Check if default templates change based on selected language
4. Test error messages during form validation in different languages

**Expected Results:**
- Default system prompts provided in the interface language
- Error messages appear in the selected language
- Form placeholders and hints respect language selection
- Date/time formatting may be locale-appropriate (if implemented)

---

### Language Testing Performance Verification

**Console Monitoring for i18n:**
- i18n initialization messages: "Initializing svelte-i18n with initial locale: [locale]"
- Locale loading confirmations: "Locale set to: [locale]"
- No missing translation warnings
- No i18n loading errors

**Network Requests for Language Files:**
- Verify locale JSON files are loaded when language changes
- Check for efficient caching of language resources
- Ensure no unnecessary re-fetching of already loaded languages

### Language Testing Known Issues

1. **News Content:** May appear in Spanish even when interface is in other languages (content-specific)
2. **System Prompts:** Intentionally multilingual - Spanish prompts are expected
3. **OpenWebUI Integration:** May have different language support than LAMB core
4. **MCP Server Names:** Technical names may remain in English across all languages

---

## Success Criteria

All test cases should pass with:
- No critical errors in console
- All expected UI elements present and functional
- Proper data persistence
- Correct user session management
- Appropriate error handling for invalid inputs
- **Complete language consistency in selected language**
- **No mixed language content in user interface**
