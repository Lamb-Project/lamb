## 📋 Project Description

**LAMB** (Learning Assistants Manager and Builder) is an open-source web platform that enables educators to design, test, and publish AI-based learning assistants into your Learning Management System (LMS like Moodle) without writing any code. It functions as a visual "teaching chatbot builder" that seamlessly combines large language models (GPT-4, Mistral, local models) with your own educational materials.

Developed by Marc Alier and Juanan Pereira, professors and researchers at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU), LAMB addresses the critical need for educational AI tools that maintain student privacy while providing powerful, context-aware learning support.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🎓 **Specialized Subject Tutors**
Design assistants that stay grounded on your chosen subject area, ensuring responses are always educationally appropriate and contextually relevant.

### 📚 **Intelligent Knowledge Ingestion**
Upload educational materials (PDF, Word, Markdown) and LAMB automatically processes them with:
- Flexible data model that preserves context and relationships
- Semantic embeddings optimized for educational search
- Custom metadata support for each document
- Adaptive processing for different content structures
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) integration

### 🔒 **Privacy-First Architecture**
- The students will access the Learning Assitants as Learning Activities within the LMS Course
- No user information is shared with AI model providers
- Can run on open source and open weights models running on your compute
- Secure, self-hosted solution

### 🔌 **LTI Integration**
Seamlessly integrate with Moodle and other Learning Management Systems through LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) standard - publish your assistant as an external tool with just a few clicks.

### 🤖 **Multi-Model Support**
- Works with OpenAI API compatible models
- Ollama inetgration
- One-click model switching
- Model-agnostic architecture

### 🔍 **Advanced Testing & Debugging**
- Debug mode showing complete prompts
- Citation tracking with source references


### 🌍 **Multilingual Interface**
Built-in support for Basque, Catalan, Spanish, and English, with easy extensibility for additional languages.  

### 💾 **Portability & Versioning**
- Export/import assistants in JSON format


## 👥 Target Audience

LAMB is designed for:

- **📖 Teachers and Trainers**: Create virtual assistants focused on specific curricula without technical expertise
- **🏫 Educational Institutions**: Integrate AI into existing LMS platforms while maintaining data sovereignty
- **💡 Innovation Teams**: Experiment with different LLMs through a unified management interface
- **🔬 Researchers**: Study AI in education with complete control over the learning environment

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

LAMB features a modular, extensible architecture:

- **Backend**: FastAPI-based server handling assistant management, LTI integration, and model orchestration
- **Frontend**: Modern Svelte 5 application providing intuitive UI for assistant creation and management
- **Knowledge Base Server**: Dedicated service for document ingestion and vector search
- **Integration Layer**: Bridges with Open WebUI for model management  https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui

## 🚀 Installation

### Recommended: Docker Installation

For the easiest setup experience, we recommend using Docker Compose to run all LAMB services:

📘 **[Docker Installation Guide](Documentation/deployment.md)** - One-command deployment with all services configured

> **⚡ Performance Tip**: LAMB uses Docker BuildKit cache for faster builds. Docker 23.0+ enables this automatically. For older versions, see [Docker BuildKit Cache Guide](DOCKER_BUILDKIT_CACHE.md) for setup instructions and benefits.

### Alternative: Manual Installation

For development or custom deployments:

📘 **[Complete Installation Guide](Documentation/installationguide.md)** - Step-by-step manual setup for all components

### Quick Overview

LAMB requires four main services:
1. **Open WebUI Server** (port 8080) - Model management interface
2. **LAMB Knowledge Base Server** (port 9090) - Document processing and vector search
3. **LAMB Backend Server** (port 9099) - Core API and business logic
4. **Frontend Application** (port 5173) - Web interface

## 🛡️ Safe AI in Education Manifesto

LAMB proudly adheres to the **[Safe AI in Education Manifesto](https://manifesto.safeaieducation.org)** - a comprehensive framework for ethical, secure, and educationally-aligned AI deployment.

### 📋 Manifesto TLDR

The Safe AI in Education Manifesto outlines 7 core principles for responsible AI use in education:

1. **Human Oversight** - AI complements, never replaces, human educators
2. **Privacy Protection** - Student data confidentiality and security
3. **Educational Alignment** - AI supports institutional strategies and learning objectives
4. **Didactic Integration** - Seamless integration with teaching methodologies
5. **Accuracy & Explainability** - Reliable, source-attributed information
6. **Transparent Interfaces** - Clear communication of AI limitations and capabilities
7. **Ethical Training** - Models trained with educational ethics and transparency

### 🎯 How LAMB Implements These Principles

**LAMB is designed from the ground up to embody these principles:**

- **🔍 Human Oversight**: All assistants are created and managed by educators with full control over behavior and content
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: Self-hosted architecture keeps all student data within institutional control
- **📚 Educational Focus**: Specialized subject tutors stay grounded in educational content and objectives
- **🧠 Didactic Integration**: Seamless LTI integration with Moodle and other LMS platforms
- **📖 Source Attribution**: Automatic citations and references to source materials
- **💬 Transparent Communication**: Clear assistant responses with educational context and limitations
- **🎓 Ethical Foundation**: Open-source, academically-developed with research collaboration

### 🤝 Our Commitment

As signatories to the manifesto, LAMB's core team members are committed to advancing ethical AI in education. LAMB represents a practical implementation of manifesto principles in action.
