00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,140
- [Narrator] King Louie and his family

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,330
were now in the Tuileries Palace in Paris,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,920
where for the next couple of years,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,630
he watched as the revolutionary government

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,580
began to strip away his power

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,110
and fearing for his safety,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,640
he had to stay on their good side.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,080
Hey, look who it is.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,670
It's my favorite revolutionaries.

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,650
Yep, I'm your number one fan.

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,880
What can I do for you?

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,713
Hey, King Louie.

13
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,100
So we've made a few decisions.

14
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,900
First, all of your friends in the nobility

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,570
are gonna have to pay taxes
the same as everyone else.

16
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,740
Great idea.

17
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,573
I love it.

18
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:30,600
And as a side note,

19
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,180
the tax money can no longer pay
for all your lavish parties.

20
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,250
Great, I hate those parties.

21
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,390
They're so awkward.

22
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,190
And also we're taking away your Porsche.

23
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,810
Ah, come on.

24
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,400
I mean,

25
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,233
Yay.

26
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,790
The king continually
found demand after demand

27
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,623
being made of him

28
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,400
to prove his support for the revolution.

29
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,360
On one occasion,

30
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,710
a mob would invade the palace

31
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,810
and demand he wear the
revolutionary bonnet.

32
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,510
This is the face of a
man who is definitely

33
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,580
pretending he wants to wear that bonnet.

34
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,413
Now around here,

35
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,580
I wanna mention that one thing
King Louie had a problem with

36
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,650
was people constantly raiding his palace,

37
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,330
but one thing he didn't
have a problem with

38
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,380
was raiding noobs

39
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,500
on this video's sponsor,

57

to start your journey.

58
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,653
Good luck and I'll see you there.

59
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,490
Now, where was I?

60
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,303
Oh yeah.

61
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:46,650
Seeing the situation
rapidly turning against him,

62
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,530
the king decided it might be
a good idea to leave France

63
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,230
and mount a campaign to retake
his country from abroad.

64
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,400
Luckily for him,

65
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,930
he was married to an Austrian.

66
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,570
So on the night of June 20th, 1791,

67
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,210
the king in his family
disguised themselves as servants

68
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,910
and attempted to flee to
the Austrian Netherlands.

69
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,370
The royal carriage made a
stop in the town of Varennes

70
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,847
and the postmaster there was like,

71
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,130
"hey guys, what's up?

72
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,060
Where are you off to?"

73
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,960
We are but a collection

74
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,970
of inconspicuous servants
heading for the border

75
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,890
for no particular reason at all.

76
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,040
Say, you, the fat one.

77
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,750
You look kind of familiar.

78
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,070
Aren't you the king?

79
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,910
Nope.

80
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,920
Let me see your passport.

81
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,810
It says here, you're King Louis the 16th.

82
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,373
Nope, not me.

83
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,940
Take him away, boys.

84
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,980
The King was promptly returned to Paris,

85
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,720
but now the jig was up.

86
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,490
His lack of support for the revolution

87
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,960
was clear to all

88
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,210
and many considered him
a straight up traitor

89
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,100
who tried to abandon his people.

90
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,933
As a result,

91
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:48,300
the new Constitution of 1791
completely reduced his powers

92
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
to that of a simple figurehead,

93
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,630
a constitutional monarch.

94
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,070
However radicals,

95
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,720
such as those in the Jacobin Club,

96
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,810
were outraged that the king
wasn't to be removed entirely.

97
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,710
So a month later,

98
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,240
these radicals staged a protest

99
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,090
on the Champ de Mars calling
for the king's removal.

100
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,850
The government of Paris feared
an insurrection was mounting

101
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,160
and they sent the military
to disperse the crowd.

102
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,690
The confrontation escalated

103
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,000
and resulted in the
revolutionary National Guard

104
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,700
firing on a crowd of revolutionaries.

105
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,470
It was a massacre.

106
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,750
The incident exposed a deep division

107
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,880
within the brotherhood of the revolution.

108
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,713
On one side,

109
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,220
the moderates who wanted to keep the King

110
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,270
as a figurehead,

111
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,240
on the other radicals who
wanted to see the king deposed

112
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,380
and heads roll.

113
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,850
In the wake of the massacre,

114
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,850
these radicals received a wave of support.

115
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,380
And speaking of rolling heads,

116
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,750
one form of equality of
the revolution introduced

117
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,580
was a quality in execution.

118
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,740
This meant no more torturous
drawing and quartering,

119
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,090
no more inhumane hanging.

120
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,440
They wanted all criminals,

121
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,740
regardless of economic status
to receive the same penalty.

122
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,270
A quick and painless one.

123
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,030
Luckily, a man by the name
of Dr. Joseph Guillotine

124
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,110
had an idea.

125
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,000
A heavy blade that falls like thunder.

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,980
The head flies off, blood spurts,

127
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,270
and the man is no more.

128
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,090
The guillotine, otherwise
known as the National Razor.

129
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,610
The guillotine made its debut in 1791

130
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,560
as the new form of execution.

131
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,640
The writings of Marat

132
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,830
and others continued to
call for the execution

133
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,330
of anyone suspected of working

134
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,740
against the revolution.

135
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,573
For him,

136
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,830
this included some members
of the clergy and nobility

137
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,000
who had previously benefited

138
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,710
from the cruel system of inequality

139
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,660
that existed before the revolution.

140
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,190
In many parts of the countryside,

141
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,590
local lords had found
themselves become a target.

142
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,080
Sire, the peasants, they're revolting.

143
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,913
Oh, come on.

144
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:26,746
That's a bit harsh.

145
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:27,579
Sure, they smell a bit,

146
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,030
but I wouldn't say they're revolting.

147
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,530
Oh, yes, I see what you mean.

148
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,360
Increasingly, these French aristocrats

149
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,250
began fleeing France to find solitude

150
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,510
in other parts of Europe.

151
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,440
And once again,

152
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,090
fear began to take hold.

153
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,310
The privileged classes
of these foreign nations

154
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,420
didn't like what they were seeing

155
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,220
because they feared revolutionary ideas

156
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,810
may spread to their own lands.

157
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,010
The National Assembly,

158
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,990
actually now the Legislative Assembly

159
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,780
feared that these nations
may decide to attack.

160
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,820
Then why don't we attack them first?

161
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,653
No, you idiots.

162
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,630
We are definitely not ready for war yet.

163
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,340
Did somebody say something?

164
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,730
France declared war in
Austria in April, 1792

165
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,200
and immediately got pummeled.

166
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,600
It also didn't help that
Austria's ally, Prussia,

167
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,590
joined in the fighting.

168
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,760
The Prussian Duke of Brunswick

169
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,740
posted a letter warning
the revolutionaries

170
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,450
that if anything happened to the King,

171
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,550
he would burn Paris to the ground.

172
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,310
The Duke's letter proved
to be a massive success

173
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,840
in inspiring the people of Paris

174
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,330
to do the exact opposite
of what he intended.

175
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,920
They were enraged by the threat.

176
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,050
And on the 10th of August, 1792,

177
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,940
the tension in the city exploded

178
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,830
and a mob stormed the king's palace.

179
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,630
Fighting broke out between
the revolutionaries

180
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,130
and the king's Swiss guard

181
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,900
with casualties in the 100s.

182
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,733
King Louis fled

183
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,500
and took refuge in the chamber
of the legislative assembly

184
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,480
where Robespierre and his radical Jacobins

185
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,980
were gaining evermore power.

186
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,630
Given the developing situation,

187
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,460
the chamber decided to hold a vote.

188
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,040
And in what some considered
to be a second revolution,

189
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,130
it was decided to suspend
the monarchy entirely.

190
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,000
King Louis the 16th was
now just plain old Louis

191
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
and he was sent to a prison cell

192
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,270
where an eye could be kept on him.

193
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,103
A month later,

194
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,060
the newly established national convention

195
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,190
officially declared the French Republic

196
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,830
and society underwent a massive change.

197
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,510
Enlightened ideas of democracy

198
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,340
and equality were being implemented.

199
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,210
But very quickly,

200
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,000
these ideas seemed to
become secondary to fear,

201
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
paranoia and a thirst for blood.

202
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,710
The new republic began
working to violently remove

203
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,050
any semblance of the old royalist regime.

204
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,760
The church became a prime target.

205
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,980
Priests who refused to take
a oath to the revolution

206
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,600
were deported or arrested.

207
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,910
A new state-sponsored atheistic religion

208
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,470
named the Cult of Reason was created

209
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,360
as a replacement for the Catholic Church.

210
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,580
Notre Dam, along with many other churches,

211
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,440
had the religious treasures destroyed

212
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
and were converted to temples of reason.

213
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,520
Even the Christian
calendar didn't survive,

214
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,520
as a brand new revolutionary
calendar was soon introduced.

215
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,930
Hey honey, I'm home.

216
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah, whatever jerk.

217
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,630
Whoa, what's wrong with you?

218
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,980
You forgot.

219
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,030
Forgot what?

220
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,863
Everything.

221
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:50,280
This entire year,

222
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,050
my birthday was on the third of Germinal.

223
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,150
Our anniversary was the 12th of Thermidor

224
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,860
and you promised that in Frimaire,

225
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,930
we'd go on a romantic
weekend trip to Venice.

226
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,180
No, I said would do that in December.

227
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,450
December hasn't been a thing for years.

228
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,650
The government of Paris

229
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,020
now under the control of
the radical San-Culottes

230
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,810
began rounding up suspected
enemies of the revolution

231
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,240
and sending them to prison in the 1000s.

232
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,250
Naturally, a large
number of those arrested

233
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,950
were members of the
clergy and aristocracy.

234
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,530
As Francis foreign enemies
continued to close in,

235
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,580
panic spread.

236
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,440
Georges Danton made impassioned calls

237
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
for men to defend the republic

238
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,350
and tens of 1000s of troops

239
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,120
left Paris for the front lines.

240
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,740
However, in their absence,

241
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,900
Paris was left to its own devices.

242
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,730
As enemy troops arrived in Verdun,

243
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,980
the people of Paris feared
that their crowded prisons

244
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,240
were becoming a breeding ground

245
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,700
for counterrevolutionary conspiracy.

246
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,920
What would happen if the
Prussians reached Paris

247
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,300
and freed the aristocrats?

248
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,190
Marat believed he knew what would happen.

249
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,350
The aristocrats would
enact their vengeance

250
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,250
on the people.

251
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,320
Fearing those they had already imprisoned,

252
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,750
mobs descended on Paris's prisons.

253
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,583
They broke in.

254
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,990
And during the brutal September massacres,

255
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,510
aristocrats, priests and others

256
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,510
were tried and executed on the spot.

257
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,180
Even women and children weren't spared.

258
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,490
With over 1,600 victims,

259
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,800
word of the massacre spread across Europe.

260
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,390
One British newspaper wondered,

261
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,830
are these the rights of men?

262
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,020
Is this the liberty of human nature?

263
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,730
But there was still one man in particular

264
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,350
that Robespierre and his radicals

265
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,030
really wanted to see executed.

266
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,800
Austria and Prussia pledged that

267
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,240
after they defeated France,

268
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,040
they'd returned King Louis to the throne.

269
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,750
Well checkmate Austria and Prussia

270
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,700
because he can't return
a man to the throne

271
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,780
if he's already dead.

272
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,840
Citizen Louis Capet was
put on trial for treason.

273
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,430
Obviously he was found guilty,

274
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,230
but his punishment was less certain.

275
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,540
Many moderates wanted
to simply deport him.

276
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,480
But Robespierre insisted the
revolution could only live

277
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,280
if the king was dead.

278
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,530
A vote was held and by just one vote,

279
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,960
Louis was sentenced to the guillotine.

280
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
If you don't mind,

281
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
I'd like to say a few words first.

282
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,910
Gentlemen, I am innocent of everything

283
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,930
of which I am accused...

284
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,160
Wait, you're too loud.

285
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,060
They can't hear me.

286
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,740
Hang on, I haven't finished yet.

287
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,633
Wait, dude.

288
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,860
Uncool.

289
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,150
In her prison cell,

290
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,070
Marie Antoinette heard the guns fire

291
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,260
signaling her husband's death.

292
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,430
Before long,

293
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,890
she would meet the same fate.

294
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,000
Back on the war front,

295
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,770
France defied all expectations,

296
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,990
and actually managed
to push the enemy back.

297
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,610
But then more countries
joined the coalition

298
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,650
against France and it
all went to pot again.

299
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,550
What do we do?

300
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,200
Conscript the masses.

301
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,780
The National Convention
introduced a conscription law

302
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,010
with each regional department

303
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,530
having to meet a certain
quota of men for the army.

304
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,350
However, not everyone was
happy with this new law.

305
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,720
You see, while Paris
was definitely a hotbed

306
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,700
for radical revolutionary fervor,

307
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,320
some of the regions outside of Paris

308
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,420
weren't quite so keen on the revolution.

309
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,250
Some were largely still conservative,

310
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,630
still supported the church

311
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,850
and just didn't suffer
from that much inequality

312
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,930
before the revolution.

313
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,150
So as the revolution
turned increasingly violent

314
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,910
and anti-Christian, many were outraged.

315
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,010
Now they were being conscripted to fight

316
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,050
for the new republic they hated.

317
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,150
That was the last straw.

318
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,160
Counterrevolutionary uprisings erupted

319
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,350
in a number of regions across France.

320
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,970
Some would last for years,

321
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,320
such as in the Northwest

322
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,140
where a large scale uprising
was led by The Owls.

323
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,760
Why were they called The Owls?

324
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
Because their leader was named Jean Owl.

325
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,360
Why was he called John Owl?

326
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,440
Possibly because he could do

327
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,330
a really good impression of an owl.

328
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,163
Really?

329
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,400
That's what we're going with?

330
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,233
Owls?

331
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,610
Just because this guy can
do an impression of one?

332
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,020
Hit him with it, Jean.

333
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,853
Hoot, hoot.

334
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,893
Yeah, okay.

335
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:25,726
That's pretty good.

336
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,920
The Chouanary uprising lasted
all the way until 1800.

337
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,630
In the summer of 1793,

338
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,000
the southern city of Toulon
invited the British Navy

339
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
over for some tea and crumpets.

340
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,750
And then they asked if
they'd possibly like to stay

341
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,860
and occupy the city.

342
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,330
Being an important naval base,

343
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,160
this was a heavy blow to the republic

344
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,290
who sent a relatively
unknown young captain

345
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,940
by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte

346
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,620
to help stage the siege of the city.

347
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,020
Toulon was recaptured
by France in the winter

348
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,220
and for his service

349
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,310
Napoleon was promoted to the
rank of brigadier general.

350
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,530
The most infamous
counterrevolution, however,

351
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,210
occurred in the Vendee region.

352
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,710
Throughout 1793,

353
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,960
revolutionary forces
clashed with the region's

354
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,730
Catholic and royal army.

355
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,590
The republic defeated
the counterrevolution

356
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,510
through cruel pacification.

357
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,440
In particular,

358
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,150
general Jean Baptist Carrier

359
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,340
committed brutal atrocities.

360
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,390
In one instance,

361
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,760
he had 1000s of civilians, priests,

362
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,220
women and children tied to ships,

363
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,900
which were then sunk.

364
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,720
Carrier would later be
found guilty of war crimes

365
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,623
and executed.

366
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,780
Back in Paris,

367
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,330
the government was still
dominated by moderates.

368
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,590
With the war going badly,

369
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,530
revolts in the provinces and
the economy getting worse,

370
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,380
it seemed the government just
wasn't doing a very good job.

371
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,650
Radicals' fear for the safety
of the revolution intensified

372
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,870
and Marat even began
calling for the moderates

373
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,910
in the government to be executed.

374
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,743
In return,

375
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:47,850
the moderates called
for the arrest of Marat.

376
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,170
This led to a chain of events

377
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,150
with the two sides in heated conflict.

378
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,060
Robespierre declared the
Jacobins to be be an insurrection

379
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,310
and called on the people
to arm themselves.

380
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,430
It all ended on the 31st of May, 1793

381
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,050
with the National Convention surrounded

382
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,460
by radical Sans-culottes

383
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,090
and 29 moderate Girondin
politicians arrested.

384
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,290
From this moment on,

385
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,540
the moderate ceased to
be a political force.

386
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,280
Robespierre and his radicals

387
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,040
would be an almost total
control of the government.

388
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,480
And this brings us to the story

389
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,310
of a woman named Charlotte Corday.

390
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,800
Charlotte lived in the
northwest city of Caen

391
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,030
and like many in the area

392
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,460
was horrified at the rapid radicalization

393
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,710
and increasing violence of the revolution.

394
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,930
And the man she blamed more than anyone

395
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,790
was Jean Paul Marat.

396
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,860
She wanted to bring peace back to France.

397
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,570
And so she did something drastic.

398
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,400
She traveled to Paris and told Marat

399
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,250
she had a list of enemies for
him to publish in his paper.

400
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,710
Marat eagerly invited
her in for a meeting.

401
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,870
So where's that list of
enemies you promised me?

402
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,980
Here it is.

403
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,330
Wait a minute.

404
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,950
This isn't the list of enemies.

405
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,929
It just says "yippee ki yay mother..."

406
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:50,970
(Marat screams)

407
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,110
And just like that,

408
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,060
Marat was no more.

409
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,970
Charlotte was quickly arrested
and sent to the guillotine.

410
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,210
Her dream of restoring peace,
however, died with her.

411
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,560
Marat became a martyr.

412
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,580
In temples of reason,

413
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,050
symbols of the dead Marat

414
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,670
became the new crucifix.

415
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,503
In death,

416
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:08,670
he became an even more
powerful inspiration

417
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,320
for the extreme levels of violence

418
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,020
that were about to rip
throughout the new republic.

419
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,920
And that's right.

420
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,530
Here comes the reign of terror.

421
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,090
If you thought this revolution already

422
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,260
sounds pretty violent,

423
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,030
well you ain't seen nothing yet, son.

424
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,800
The radicals were now in control

425
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,633
and they believed

426
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,740
not only was France
surrounded by foreign enemies,

427
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,090
but that within the masses,

428
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,610
there were also plenty
of internal ones too.

429
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,770
Individuals not loyal to the revolution,

430
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,140
conspiring to bring about it's downfall.

431
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,570
Robespierre and the rest
of the radical faction

432
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,920
were having none of it.

433
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
A new committee of public safety

434
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,280
was established with 12 members.

435
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,290
Its purpose was to protect
the new French republic

436
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,220
from its enemies

437
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,530
and it basically became
a 12 man dictatorship

438
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,900
with Robespierre as its leading voice.

439
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,630
The revolutionary tribunal
was also reinstated.

440
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,340
