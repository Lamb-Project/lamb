Ran terminal command: LAMB_PROJECT_PATH=/opt/lamb docker compose config

Jumping in to wire up that Caddy reverse proxy so `lamb.ikasten.io` serves the whole stack—here’s what changed.

## actions taken
- Added a production-ready Caddyfile that routes `/creator` and `/api` to the FastAPI backend, `/kb` to the knowledge-base server, `/openwebui` to the model UI, and serves the built Svelte app for everything else.
- Extended docker-compose.yaml with a `caddy` service (ports 80/443, persistent ACME data/config volumes, shared bind mount to the built frontend) plus dependency ordering so the static build completes before Caddy starts.
- Refreshed docker.md to document the five-service stack, proxy URLs, and how the static build is handled.
- Validated the compose syntax (`docker compose config`) to be sure the new service layout is sound.

## try it
- Ensure `static/config.js` in the frontend points to `https://lamb.ikasten.io` (and matching backend/OpenWebUI URLs) before building.
- Run `docker compose up -d` (Caddy will request certificates automatically once DNS points at the host and ports 80/443 are reachable).

## quality gates
- `docker compose config` – ✅ PASS

## requirements coverage
- Reverse proxy with path-based routing for backend, KB, OpenWebUI, and static frontend at `https://lamb.ikasten.io` – **Done**

## notes & follow-ups
- Keep ports 80/443 open in the server firewall so Caddy can obtain/renew TLS certificates.
- The dev frontend container still runs; once you’re comfortable with the static build behind Caddy, you can remove or disable it to save resources.
